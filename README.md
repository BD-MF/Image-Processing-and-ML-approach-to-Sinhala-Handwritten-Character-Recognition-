# Image-Processing-and-ML-approach-to-Sinhala-Handwritten-Character-Recognition-
Sinhala handwritten character recognition system based on image processing concepts and Machine Learning approach.Isolated sinhala handwritten characters are taken as inputs and corresponding unicode character displays after going through several processes. As the feature extraction process I have proposed main three approaches; Ratio based Freeman Chain Code algorithm, Zone based density features and distance profile based approach. CSV file includes features corresponding to each sinhala handwritten characters. Support Vector Machine (SVM) Machine Learning approach is used as the train model.
